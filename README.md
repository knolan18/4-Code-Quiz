## Create a Quiz

In this assignment, a dynamic quiz was created. The welcome screen prompts the user to start the quiz by pushing the MEOW! button, which loads the questions screen. This also prompts the timer to start at 60 seconds. A question appears on the screen with 4 answer prompt buttons, a score counter, a timer, and a next button. When the user hovers over a prompt button, the border of the button darkens. When the user selects an answer prompt button, the correct answer button background changes to green, and if it is incorrect, the answer button background changes to red. If the user is correct, one point is added to their score counter. The game is over if the timer runs out, which calls an alert window informing the user that they are out of time, and asks them to record their score. If the user has answered all of the questions before time has run out, then they are presented with a button that says "record score," which calls the record player score screen. On this screen, the user is presented with a form where they can enter their name and their score, which will be added to a list of high scores once the form is submitted by pressing the submit button. The submit button calls the high scores screen, where an ordered list of high scores that have been locally stored is displayed.
